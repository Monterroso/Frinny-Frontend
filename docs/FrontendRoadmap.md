1. Keep the UI Behavior and State in a Dedicated “UI Manager”
When you create a custom UI in Foundry, you typically subclass Application (or FormApplication) to manage rendering, position, sizing, etc. Centralizing the UI code in a file like ui-manager.js (or a similarly named file) clarifies that all UI concerns live there, such as:
Creating/Rendering the chat window (using ai-chat.hbs).
Position and Size: Foundry will persist application position if you rely on standard Application inheritance. If you require more granularity, you can store explicit position/size data in either Foundry settings or the user session.
State (Opened/Closed): You can track whether a user’s UI is currently open or collapsed. This can be stored in a combination of Foundry’s persistent client settings or a user session data field.
Example Approach
Create a FrinnyChat class that extends Application, specifying default options like popOut: true (so you can move/resize it).
Override methods like render() or close() to store the user’s last-known position, size, and open/closed state in a user-specific data store.
Use Foundry Settings to auto-save or auto-restore those values, or look them up in your custom UserSession.
Because Foundry’s base Application handles windows and journaling of positions, hooking your code into that system keeps the code DRY and leverages built-in Foundry behaviors.

2. Separate the UI Logic from the Core AI Logic
UI Logic belongs in your FrinnyChat class (or your ui-manager.js) file, which does things like:
Show/hide the avatar panel.
Listen to user input from the text field.
Display the conversation history inside the template.
Core AI Logic remains in agent-manager.js so you do not accidentally mix rendering code with network calls or message processing. Your UI just calls something like:
  const userId = game.user.id;
  agentManager.handleUserQuery(userId, query).then(response => {
    // handle returning this data to the chat display
  });
This way, you can easily modify how the AI logic works down the road (e.g., different prompts, different endpoints) without touching the code that lays out or styles the chat window.
---
3. Use Foundry Settings to Handle Dynamic Config Updates
Foundry allows you to add module settings (registered via game.settings.register(...)). When a user changes a setting in the configuration tab, you can pass an onChange callback that updates your application immediately. For example:
showAvatar setting (Boolean): Toggling it on/off might show/hide the avatar within FrinnyChat.
frinnyWindowDefaults setting (Object): Possibly store default width, height, or position properties here if you’d like the user to define them in the config.
In your onChange handler, you’d call something like:
 const userId = game.user.id;
  agentManager.handleUserQuery(userId, query).then(response => {
    // handle returning this data to the chat display
  });
Then in your UI code (FrinnyChat class), you read that setting and re-render or hide the relevant section. This ensures user changes in the Foundry config tab are applied instantly, giving the user immediate feedback and preventing stale or out-of-sync states.

4. Storing and Restoring UI State
A. Foundry’s Built-In Persistence
If you rely on standard Foundry behaviors (such as a pop-out Application window), Foundry automatically saves window positions per user. However, you can override that if:
You want to store more than just position/size (e.g., whether the window was collapsed or expanded, or which “tab” is active).
You want to keep it in your own data structure or behind a specialized toggle.
B. Using the User Session
If you prefer more control, you could enhance your UserSession class:
Add a UI-related state object, e.g.:
   class UserSession {
     constructor(userId) {
       this.userId = userId;
       this.uiState = {
         isOpen: true,
         position: { left: 100, top: 100 },
         size: { width: 400, height: 300 },
       };
     }
     // ...
   }
2. Whenever your FrinnyChat is moved, resized, or closed, you call:
const userSession = getSession(game.user.id);
   userSession.uiState.position = { left, top };
   userSession.uiState.size = { width, height };
   userSession.uiState.isOpen = false;
3. Next time the user logs in, open or restore your FrinnyChat if userSession.uiState.isOpen is true, and apply the stored position/size.
This approach ensures that even if Foundry doesn’t automatically remember the state (or you want more logic around it), you keep it in your own data model that persists across sessions.

5. Putting It All Together
Below is an outline tying these suggestions into one cohesive system:
ui-manager.js (e.g., where you define FrinnyChat)
Extends Application.
Uses your ai-chat.hbs template to render an avatar panel, chat log, and input.
On render() or activateListeners(), wires up a text input that sends messages to agentManager.handleUserQuery.
On close or on move, updates the user session (userSession.uiState) with new position/dimensions.
agent-manager.js
Handles the actual calls to the AI backend.
Provides methods that the UI or Foundry hooks can call, such as handleUserQuery(userId, query) or handleLevelUp(...).
Returns the final text for the UI to display.
user-session.js
Tracks per-user data.
Stores UI-related state (open/closed, location, size) plus any chat history or partial character creation data.
Optionally, if you want to restore chat logs, you store them here so the ui-manager.js can re-display them.
main.js (or an event-listeners file)
Registers Foundry hooks for initialization, settings registration, plus any chat or actor updates that need to call agent-manager or update a user’s session data.
For instance, Hooks.on("createChatMessage") -> check if it’s !frinny -> call agentManager.handleUserQuery(...) -> post result in Foundry chat.
For config changes (say, toggling the avatar), read the new setting value and pass it to ui-manager.js to update the UI.
This structure avoids confusion:
UI code never fetches directly from the backend.
AI code never manages UI logic or user interface states.
State about the user is stored in a session object, leaving the “event hooking” and “init logic” up to main.js (or a dedicated hooks file).

6. Why This Organization Works
Clear Separation: Each file or class has exactly one responsibility (UI, state, AI calls, or hooking Foundry events).
Dynamic Config: Foundry settings can dispatch changes to the UI or do more complex logic through a single place, avoiding repeated code.
Resilient UI: Because FrinnyChat extends Foundry’s Application, you get built-in position/sizing logic with minimal overhead.
Easily Extended: If you add more “tabs” or features to your chat window, you don’t disrupt your AI logic. Likewise, adding new AI endpoints doesn’t affect your UI code beyond possibly adding new triggers for “send message.”
In short, centralizing UI in one file, AI logic in another, storing user-specific data in UserSession, and hooking them all together in main.js or a dedicated “listeners” file ensures the entire system remains clean, DRY, and easy to expand.
